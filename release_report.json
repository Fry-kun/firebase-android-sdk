                "message": "Migrate VertexAI serialization to be localized (#6631)\n\nThere are some considerations to how this should be finalized. Current\r\nimplementation details that I've decided on which we can change:\r\n* Based on the example doc, all classes `Foo` have been renamed\r\n`InternalFoo`\r\n* All internal serialization classes, where relevant, are moved to inner\r\nclasses of their API counterparts\r\n* All classes only used as child fields for serialization classes have\r\nbeen moved to inner classes of those classes\r\n* All `toPublic` and `toInternal` methods on API and serialization\r\nclasses have been moved inside of those classes and `conversions.kt` has\r\nbeen mostly emptied.\r\n* A few serialization classes do not have API equivalents and are left\r\nin a `Types.kt` file\r\n\r\nPossible changes:\r\n* Change all `InternalFoo` classes to have the same name, referenced as\r\n`Foo.Internal` rather than `Foo.InternalFoo`. This will probably make\r\nthe codebase feel cleaner, but I'll wait for opinions on it\r\n* Move serialization only classes out of the internal serialization\r\nclasses, either to inner classes of the API classes or top level classes\r\nthemselves.\r\n* For classes that have serializers, rename serializers from\r\n`InternalFooSerializer` to `Serializer` for example\r\n`Foo.InternalFoo.Serializer` or `Foo.Internal.Serializer` instead of\r\n`Foo.InternalFoo.InternalFooSerializer` or\r\n`Foo.Internal.InternalFooSerializer`",
